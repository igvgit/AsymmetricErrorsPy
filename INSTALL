This is a description how to install the "asepy" Python wrapper and
utilities for the "ase" (Asymmetric Errors) package on your computer.

Naturally, you have to install the "ase" package first. Get it from
https://github.com/igvgit/AsymmetricErrors
There, you will find a file called ase-X.Y.tar.gz (where X.Y stands
for the version number, 0.7 at the time of this writing). Download
and install that.

Make sure that you have a good Python distribution. In addition to
Python standard packages, you will need at least numpy and matplotlib.
Anaconda Python distribution is known to work well.

Edit the variables ASE_INCLUDE_DIR and ASE_LIB_DIR in the file
"Makefile". ASE_INCLUDE_DIR should be set in such a way that the file 
$ASE_INCLUDE_DIR/ase/AbsDistributionModel1D.hh
can be found on your computer. ASE_LIB_DIR should be set in such a way
that the file $ASE_LIB_DIR/libase.so can be found on your computer.
Then run "make".

If this does not work, you may have to regenerate the Python wrapper
for your system. Make sure that you have a recent version of swig.
Version 4.0.2 is known to work. You can get the latest version at
https://www.swig.org/download.html

Edit the variable ASE_INCLUDE_DIR in the file "Makefile.swig" (should
be set in the same way as in the "Makefile"). Then run the following:

make -f Makefile.swig distclean
make -f Makefile.swig
make

The wrapper will not be installed in any special location on your
computer. It will just reside in this directory. Because of this,
you will need to add this directory to your PYTHONPATH environmental
variable so that commands like "import asepy" in Python scripts
will be correctly executed.

Some examples on how to use the wrapper can be found in the directory
"examples".
